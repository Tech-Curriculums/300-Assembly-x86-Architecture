300-Assembly-x86-Architecture
=============================

In this class we learn how to write really efficient code, without the restrictions of compiled languages.


Topics will include:

1. Genetic Algorithms
  * AI
2. Self-replicating code
  * delete files of a certain extension
  * replicating to consume memory
  * game-of-life
3. System Vulnerability
  * countermeasures

Sub-topics:

1. Advanced Makefiles
2. guide from compiled langauge's journey to it's bits
2. x86 assemblyh
